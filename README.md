# 📚 Learning C++

Welcome to my C++ learning journey! This repository is dedicated to my progress in mastering the C++ programming language. My primary motivations for taking on this powerful language are rooted in a few key areas that I'm passionate about.

# 💻 System Administration & Infrastructure

My goal is to become a more effective sysadmin. C++'s performance and control over system resources make it an ideal language for writing efficient command-line tools and for understanding and maintaining existing C++-based infrastructure.

# ⚙️ Hardware and Performance

I have a passion for hardware, and C++'s direct access to memory and low-level features makes it incredibly fast. Learning C++ will help me better understand how software interacts with hardware, which is a crucial skill for anyone interested in high-performance computing.

# 🎮 Game Development

C++ is the cornerstone of the game development world. I'm excited to explore game engines and development tools, and I know that a solid C++ foundation will be essential for building my own games in the future.

# 🧠 Foundational Skills

I've heard that C++ teaches you a lot about core computer science concepts, like memory management and data structures, that are often hidden in other languages. I believe this will make me a more well-rounded and knowledgeable software developer.
